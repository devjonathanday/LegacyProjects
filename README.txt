Legacy Projects!

This is an archive of any projects I no longer intend to work on, or ones that are for demonstration purposes only.
Below is a description of each project.

GravityJumper - Side project made using Raylib, a C++ (originally C) graphics library. Implements a custom camera controller, file loading, and various other essentials for game development in a non-engine environment.

RaylibPlatformer - Side project made with Raylib, refines some of the classes implemented in GravityJumper. Solid example of building my own physics, albeit very minimal, also features sprite sheet animation.

VRCARDS - My final project at Sno-Isle Skills Center, and my first VR project. I may or may not work with VR in the future, if I do I will probably be referencing certain techniques in this project.

CSharpPlatformer - More or less a re-do of RaylibPlatformer, created with Raylib and utilizes a .dll for C# bindings to use native functions. Features the same physics code, refined for performance.

Platformer2D - A 2D platformer made in Unity. Features a mostly complete implementation of a basic 2D player controller.

ComputerGraphicsProjects - Practice projects from AIE, made during a graphics programming unit. Features various rendering techniques made with Unity3D.
